# Documentation

This directory contains documentation assets for the Temporal Seats project.

## Files

- `screenshot.png` - Main UI screenshot showing the seat selection and payment interface

## Adding Screenshots

When adding new screenshots:

1. Use PNG format for UI screenshots (better for UI elements)
2. Optimize file size to keep the README loading fast
3. Use descriptive filenames
4. Update the main README.md to reference the new images
5. Consider creating multiple sizes if needed (e.g., `ui-screenshot-full.png` and `ui-screenshot-thumb.png`)

## Image Guidelines

- **Dimensions**: Aim for 800-1200px width for README screenshots
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB when possible
- **Alt text**: Always include descriptive alt text in markdown
- **Consistency**: Use similar styling and cropping for related screenshots
